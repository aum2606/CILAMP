# CILAMP

**Cloud Identity Lifecycle & Access Management Platform**

CILAMP is a simulation-first Cloud/IAM portfolio project. It will demonstrate employee identity lifecycle management, RBAC, least privilege, access review, auditability, and later safe lab integrations with Microsoft Entra ID, Azure, and AWS.

The repository is currently at **Phase 0 — Foundation**. No cloud APIs are connected and no live resources are modified.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Python 3.11 or later.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Open the local URL printed by Streamlit, normally <http://localhost:8501>.

The dashboard creates a local SQLite database at `data/cilamp.db`. That runtime file and all `.env` files are ignored by Git.

## Verify the foundation

```powershell
python -m pytest
```

The tests validate configuration safety, database initialization/health, project status metadata, and a headless render of the dashboard.
